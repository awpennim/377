Derek Duoba and I, Andrew Penniman, worked on this project together. Initially, I designed and implemented a Driver class which became the entrance to our program. So, you start the program with "java Driver". We also assume that you have a proper data file created with "./create_fs disk0" (would create disk0). Together, we began work on the FileSystem.java. We made some progress, then Derek took over and coded a large portion of FileSystem.java. Afterwards, I extracted some of our ideas to Inode.java. This shortened some of our larger methods in FileSystem.java (like create and destroy), and improved readability of our code.
